# Tetris on FPGA with SoC - ECE 385 Final Project
Final Project for Digital Systems Laboratory (ECE 385). Designed with system-on-chip MicroBlaze softcore processor, used to handle USB input. Capable of HDMI display, the game is controlled using a standard USB keyboard, as well as having AUDIO output through AUDIO OUT of FPGA board.

Project and constraints are designed to work for the Urbana board, with the AMD spartan-7 XC7S50-CSGA324 FPGA.

## Digital Systems Laboratory (ECE 385) - Spring 2025
## Course Description
Design, build, and test digital systems using transistor-transistor logic (TTL), SystemVerilog, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Topics include combinational and sequential logic, storage elements, input/output and display, timing analysis, design tradeoffs, synchronous and asynchronous design methods, datapath and controller, microprocessor design, software/hardware co-design, and system-on-a-chip.
